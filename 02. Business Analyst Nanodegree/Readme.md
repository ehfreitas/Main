## Overview

In this section I will document the most important concepts and all projects I was presented in Udacity's Business Analyst Nanodegree.

## Main Concepts Learnt

- CRISP-DM Framework
  The problem solving framework presented for use in business analysis was the **CR**oss **I**ndustry **S**tandard **P**rocess for **D**ata **M**ining Framework which was made for Data Mining but works well for Business Analysis problems all around.

  It is composed of 6 steps each detailed below:

  1. **Business** Issue Understanding

  What **decision** needs to be made?
  What **information** is needed to inform that decision?
  What type of **analysis** will provide the information to inform that decision?

  Decision -> Information -> Analysis

  2. **Data** Understanding
  3. Data **Preparation**
  4. Analysis / **Modeling**
  5. **Validation**
  6. **Presentation** / Visualization
