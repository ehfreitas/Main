## Overview

In this section I will document the most important concepts and all projects I was presented in Udacity's Business Analyst Nanodegree.

## Main Concepts Learnt

- CRISP-DM Framework
  The problem solving framework presented for use in business analysis was the **CR**oss **I**ndustry **S**tandard **P**rocess for **D**ata **M**ining Framework which was made for Data Mining but works well for Business Analysis problems all around.

  It is composed of 6 steps each detailed below:

  1. **Business** Issue Understanding

  - What **decision** needs to be made?
  - What **information** is needed to inform that decision?
  - What type of **analysis** will provide the information to inform that decision?

  Decision -> Information -> Analysis

  2. **Data** Understanding

  - What data is needed?
  - What data is available?
  - What are the important characteristics of the data?

  3. Data **Preparation**

  - Gathering: where are you going to get the data from? Do you need multiple sources?
  - Cleansing: The dataset may have issues that need to be solved prior to being used in the analysis. Data could be missing, incorrect or badly formatted.
  - Formatting: You may need to format the data by pivoting data, changing the way it appears or even renaming a field.
  - Blending: You might need to combine datasets to enrich your analysis.
  - Sampling: You might need to sample the dataset in order to work with a more management number of records.

  4. Analysis / **Modeling**

  - What **methodology** will be used to solve the problem?
  - What are the **important factors** or variables that will help you solve the problem?
  - **Build** a model to solve the problem
  - **Run** the model and move to validation phase

  5. **Validation**

  - Observe the key results of the model.
  - Ensure the results make sense within the context of the business model.
  - Determine whether to proceed to the next step, return to the previous phase or even restart the whole process.
  - Repeat as many time as necessary.

  6. **Presentation** / Visualization

- What is the best way to present the insights generated by the analysis?
- What is the best way to present the insights considering the audience?
- Make sure information presented is not overwhelming.
- Use results to tell a story.
- Walk the audience througth the analytical problem solving process for complex analysis.
- Referene data sources.
